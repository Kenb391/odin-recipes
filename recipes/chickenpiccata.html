            <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

                <p>The easiest chicken piccata ever! With tender, juicy chicken thighs + the most heavenly cream sauce. 30 min, start to finish. YES!!<p>
                <p>How do you like your chicken piccata? Because I like mine <strong>extra-extra</strong> creamy. You know, so you have enough sauce for your vegetables, your pasta, or you know, for the crusty bread to sop up all the good bits.</p>
                <p>So that’s exactly what we have here. Extra-extra creamy as I call it. And you know I love using boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but as always, you can substitute chicken breasts if you prefer white meat. You’ll still have all the saucy goodness to go around!</p>
                <p>Serve with the wine you cook with in this recipe – no need to let that go to waste!</p>

            <p><h2>Ingridients:</h2></p>

                <ul>

                    <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>5 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups chicken stock</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup capers, drained</li>

                </ul>

            <p><h2>Steps:</h2></p>

                <ol>
                    
                    <li>Season chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Dredge chicken in 4 tablespoons flour until evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Heat canola oil and butter in a medium skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside. Reduce heat to medium low.</li>
                    <li>Whisk in remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Gradually whisk in chicken stock, wine and lemon juice. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir in heavy cream, parsley and capers; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Return chicken to the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately.</li>
