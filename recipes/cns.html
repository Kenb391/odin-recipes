            <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

                <p>Classic chicken noodle soup that will leave you feeling so good, so warm, so cozy. Perfect for sick days and cold nights!!!<p>
                <p>It’s the dead of winter. 33 degrees F all week. Snow and ice piles everywhere. And it’s only January, meaning we basically have about 3-4 months of winter left.</p>
                <p>And now that I am officially a Midwest resident, that basically translates to having this chicken noodle soup on the regular all. winter. long. It’s so warm, so cozy, and so soothing during these chilly nights.</p>
                <p>Now this recipe uses bone-in, skinless chicken breasts which means it will take a little longer than usual for the chicken to cook through.</p>
                <p>But don’t worry, it yields the most flavorful stock and the most tender chicken bites (so it’s absolutely worth the extra time), doctored up with fresh dill and freshly squeezed lemon juice for a little bit of jazz. <strong>SO SO GOOD.</strong></p>
